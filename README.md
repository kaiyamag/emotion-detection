# Jr. I.S. - Emotion Detection with a Long Short Term Memory Model
Building off of my experience with neural networks, I plan to design a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model (a type of recurrent neural network) that takes a collection of word embeddings in a sentence as input and outputs a predicted emotion. I will use Google's GoEmotions database as my training data, FastText as my word embedding model, and the Keras library for building the LSTM model. Initially, my software will be a command-line interface where the user inputs a string of text and receives the top three emotion predictions and their percent confidence. However, one of my stretch goals is to develop a web GUI. Since Keras provides basic functions for training LSTMs, my software focus will be writing data preprocessing functions, experimenting with different model architectures, and writing a function to evaluate the accuracy of the model.
